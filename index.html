  <header>
    <p>
      The header uses the default positioning behavior, which is position: static. Because it is static, it stays in the normal document flow and is placed entirely by the CSS Grid layout rather than by offsets such as top or left. The reason the header appears at the top and stretches across the full width is because the grid-template-areas defines the header area across all three columns. Offset properties do not apply here, since static positioning ignores top, right, bottom, and left.
    </p>
  </header>

  <nav>
    <p>
      The navigation section is positioned using CSS Grid with grid-area: nav, which places it in the left column of the second row. This element does not use relative, absolute, or fixed positioning, so it remains in normal flow. Its exact position is determined by the grid structure and column widths rather than by offsets. Because it is not positioned, properties like top or left would not move it even if they were added.
    </p>
  </nav>

  <main>
    <p>
      The main content area is positioned using grid-area: content, which places it in the center column of the grid. This column uses the fr unit, allowing it to expand and take up remaining space between the two side columns. The main element does not rely on the position property, so offsets such as top or bottom are unnecessary. Its placement and size are controlled entirely by the grid layout.
    </p>
  </main>

  <aside>
    <p>
      The aside element is positioned using grid-area: side, which places it in the right column of the second row. This works because CSS Grid defines a fixed-width column for the sidebar, ensuring it stays aligned next to the main content. Since the aside is not removed from normal flow, it aligns cleanly with the other grid items. Offset properties are not used because the grid already determines its location.
    </p>
  </aside>

  <footer>
    <p>
      The footer is positioned using grid-area: footer, which places it across all three columns in the final row of the grid. Its position at the bottom of the page is achieved by the grid layout combined with the container’s height of 100vh, not by bottom offsets or fixed positioning. Because the footer remains in normal flow, it scrolls naturally with the page content.
