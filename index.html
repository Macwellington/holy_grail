<header>
    <p>
        This header is default static positioning, so it stays in normal page flow where the browser puts it. Top/left/right/bottom won’t move it because it isn’t positioned.
    </p>
</header>

<nav>
    <p>
        This nav is position: fixed, so it’s locked to the viewport and doesn’t scroll. The top and left values control exactly where it sits on the screen.
    </p>
</nav>

<div class="articles">
    <article>
        <p>
            This article is position: relative, so it stays in the layout but can be nudged. The top value pushes it down from its normal spot.
        </p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <p>
            This one is also relative, so it can be shifted without messing up the overall flow. The offset just moves it visually from where it would normally be.
        </p>
    </article>
</div>

<aside>
    <p>
        This aside is position: absolute, so it’s taken out of normal flow and placed using offsets. Since there’s no positioned parent, it’s positioned relative to the viewport.
    </p>
</aside>

<footer>
    <p>
        This footer is fixed with bottom: 0, so it stays stuck to the bottom of the viewport. It stays visible even when you scroll.
    </p>
</footer>

</body>
</html>
